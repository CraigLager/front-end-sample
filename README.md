# Front End Basic Template

## Running this template
You need a webserver in any sort of flavour. There are no dependencies on any server side languages, the whole sample is essentially a static site. The [chrome web server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) is excellent.

## What you should be editing
Any files within /views and /css can be freely editing. Feel free to add new files as needed.

## What you probably shouldn't be editing
Any other files, including index.html. That said, if you really need to or want to - go ahead, but please document why.

## Build tools
Use of SASS, LESS, and any other build tools you want are permitted. However, what is sent back to us should be considered production ready and not need any processes running to work.
